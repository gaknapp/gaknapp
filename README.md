## 📜 About Me
I have grown up with technology throughout my life. 
I've always wanted to have a better understanding of how it works and 
how I can apply digital modification or solutions to my own life.

In the field of cybersecurity, I have observed that there are a lot of good job prospects. 
This, combined with my inherent curiosity for digital knowledge, has made
me committed to pursuing a degree in cybersecurity, as well as unofficially learning
about AI, which I hope can help me in my career.
